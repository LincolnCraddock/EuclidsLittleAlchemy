**Objectives**:

The honors project satisfies objective a) integrate knowledge acquired in previous course work and life because I used a lot of my previous programming experience in creating the project. I also think it met objective f) acquire a factual foundation regarding the historical development of mathematics, and objective k) compare, contrast, and evaluate differing expositions about the same topic in the history of mathematics. Studying Euclid’s Elements so much definitely gave me a pretty solid understanding of it, which I think gives me a pretty good understanding of that historical development in mathematics; and I also got to see the different ways it’s been interpreted across time, such as the difference between Oliver Byrne’s version of the Elements and the other modern versions I looked at.
